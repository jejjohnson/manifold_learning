This program efficiently computes an approximate kNN graph for high
dimensional data via divide and conquer. Currently it supports only
dense data (well, of course you can store sparse data using the same
format as dense data, but this way looses the benefit of the
exploitable sparsity.) The algorithm has two versions: a glue version
and an overlap version. Usually, you can set the parameter r (overlap
size) to be 0.3 and 0.15 for the glue version and the overlap version,
respectively, for good performance (high quality and low run
time). But you may need to tune the parameter for a desirable result.
Note that in the resulting graph, it is not guaranteed that each point
has exactly k nearest neighbors. But the case of not computing the
exact number of required neighbors is highly unlikely.

Version: 2009.10.13
Language: C++

Files in This Directory
=======================

* main.cpp
  The main file. This file shows how to use the routines to compute a
  knn graph. Source files include:

      aux_func.h,       aux_func.cpp
      dynamic_array.h,  dynamic_array.cpp
      knn_algo.h,       knn_algo.cpp
      linear_algebra.h, linear_algebra.cpp

* knn
  The executable compiled under Ubuntu Linux for the provided main.cpp.

* Makefile
  An example makefile.

* example.dat
  An example data file for input. The data is indeed the FREY data set
  (http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~roweis/data.html), which contains 1965
  data points of 560 dimensions.

* example.knn
  An example output knn file.

* README
  This file.



Input File Format (ex: example.dat)
===================================

Every 8-byte is a double precision number. A consecutive chunk of D
numbers form a D-dimensional data point. There are n data points. Thus
the input file has 8*n*D bytes.

Note that in order to save storage, this file format is not ASCII. But
you can modify the function read_X_from_file() in aux_func.cpp to
accept whatever format you want.



Output File Format (ex: example.knn)
====================================

The contents of this file are formatted in 3 columns: i, j, and v. In
each row, i is a k-nearest-neighbor of j. The Euclidean distance
between i and j is v. This file is ASCII.

you can modify the function output_knn() in dynamic_array.cpp to
output whatever format you want.
